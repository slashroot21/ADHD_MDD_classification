# ADHD_MDD_classification
ADHD and MDD detection using EEG signals. The experiment involves extracting linear and morphological features from the single and feeding those features into various classification models (KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Hybrid Classifier models) for classification. We have also provided a prediction model built using Voting Classifier.
## Setup
